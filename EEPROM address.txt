max 64 points or occupance detectors, 
2 bytes per item
needed: 128 bytes 0x80
IO number is linked to physical address

streets 16 points per street max,
2 bytes per point (state included)
nAmount of street 128
needed: 4096 bytes or 0x1000
address is dynamically allocated

It is needed to dynamically alocate memory to point streets.
2 inputs numbers must be linked to an address. There is no correlation between input numbers and eeprom address
Therefor we need a special part in memory to store the links

2 bytes for 2 buttons = 1 street
2 bytes for eeprom address
nAmount of street 128
needed: 512 bytes or 0x200

ITEM		address
accessoires 	0x0000 - 0x007F  (0x0080 bytes)
streets		0x0080 - 0x107F  (0x1000 bytes)
mem links	0x1080 - 0x127F  (0x0200 bytes)
